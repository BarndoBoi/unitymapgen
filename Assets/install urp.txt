in LayerTerrain.NormalizeFinalMap comment out minValue line (  finalTile.ValuesHere[layer] = Mathf.Max(0, finalTile.ValuesHere[layer] - minValue);  )


in All biomes where we set elevation band values, set water to 0 and beach sand to 0.1 
(at this point, you should see no water and just have the beach extend down to the sea floor)

IgniteCoders --> Simple Water Shader --> Prefabs --> place WaterBlock_50m in the scene as child of Terrain object,
							scale to the size of the map, (we will be doing this programatically later)
							set position Y Value to water level (mines at 3)
