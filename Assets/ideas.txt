You have a radar, but it can only be used 3 times. a "use" is a single circular rotation of the radar. 
	If something is in your veryClose distance, it shows as a dot.
	if far away, maybe a 90Â° highlight on the outside of the circular radar UI thingy? or maybe 1/3 of the circle?
	and maybe that highlight is randomized, so it's TRULY "somewhere in that range there is SOMETHING...





You have limited gas?
	I really like the idea of having randomized depots, where you can refill gas/radar/fix boat?
