first-person, y-value on camera doesn't change, but can rotate around.

You have a radar, but it can only be used X times. a "use" is a single circular rotation of the radar. 
	If something is in your Radar distance, it shows as a dot.
	if far away, maybe a 90Â° highlight on the outside of the circular radar UI thingy? or maybe 1/3 of the circle?
	and maybe that highlight is randomized for that point, so it's truly "somewhere in that range there is SOMETHING...


You have limited gas?
	I really like the idea of having randomized depots, where you can refill gas/radar/fix boat?
	Those areas where it's a little cove could be a GREAT spot to have these get spawned...
	maybe we mark those as safe spots that enemy boats can't drive/shoot into?


leveling to ubnlock new boats and shots and things

quests to destroy X items, which gives XP to get new boats??
